# logFaces Appender (HTTP) for log4js-node

The logFaces appenders send JSON formatted log events to [logFaces](http://www.moonlit-software.com) receivers. This appender uses HTTP to send the events (there is another logFaces appender that uses [UDP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logFaces-UDP)).

```bash
npm install log4js @log4js-node/logfaces-http
```

## Configuration

- `type` - `@log4js-node/logfaces-http`
- `url` - `string` - logFaces receiver servlet URL
- `application` - `string` (optional, defaults to empty string) - used to identify your application's logs
- `timeout` - `integer` (optional, defaults to 5000ms) - the timeout for the HTTP request.
- `configContext` - function (optional) returning a global context object accessible to all appenders. Properties from configContext added as `p_` values in the logFaces event.
- `hostname` - `string` (optional) - used to add the hostname `h` property to the logFaces event.
- `agent` - `http.Agent | https.Agent` (optional) - used to configure the requests being sent out if needed.
- `eventLayout` - `(LoggingEvent, LogFacesEvent) => LogFacesEvent` (optional) - allows more control and ability to modify and set the properties of the LogFacesEvent that will get sent to the server. Note: returning `null` or `undefined` will cause the event to be ignored and not logged. If you don't set `LogFacesEvent.m`, the default format for the message will be applied.

This appender will also pick up Logger context values from the events, and add them as `p_` values in the logFaces event. See the example below for more details. Note that Logger context may override the same properties defined in `configContext`.

# Example (default config)

```javascript
// global context variables can be specified like this
// these variables will propagate to logFaces server with all requests
const MDC = {
  sessionID: 111,
};

// log4js framework configuration
log4js.configure({
  appenders: {
    logfaces: {
      type: "@log4js-node/logfaces-http",
      url: "http://lfs-server/logs",
      application: "TesterApp",
      configContext: () => MDC,
    },
  },
  categories: {
    default: { appenders: ["logfaces"], level: "info", enableCallStack: true },
  },
});

// instances of the logger is obtained from framework like this
const logger = log4js.getLogger();

// local context variables can propagate to logFaces along with global context
logger.addContext("requestId", "123");
logger.info("some interesting log message");

// global context variables can be modified anywhere in the app
MDC.sessionID = 222;
logger.error("something has gone wrong", new Error("exception message"));
```

This example will result in two log events being sent to `lfs-server`. Both events will have a `requestId` property with a value of `123`. First event will have `sessionID` of `111` and second `sessionID` of `222`. Also since `enableCallStack` is set, both events will include location details such as file name, function name and line number. Second event will have a stack trace of a trown error.
